# HTML5 client for Xpra

Simply point your browser to the contents of the `html5` folder,
and you will get an HTML5 client you can use to connect to
an [xpra](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra) server.

This client is usually packaged as `xpra-html5`
and the xpra server will normally pick it up automatically
so that you can use the xpra server as a web server.
